# GPU Comparator

In this web you'll can see the differences between 2 grphic cards at the same time

## Description

This is the first prototype of my web site, here I want to make a web where
you can compare different types of graphic cards, but for the moment I don't
have the knowledge to make it, so in the meantime you can see a few gpu images
and some tables, enjoy.
